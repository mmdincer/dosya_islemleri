# file_operations
First, open a text editor and copy the script code into a new file. Save the file with any name you want, but make sure it ends with the ".sh" extension. For example, you can name the file "file_operations.sh".

Next, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the script file. For example, if the file is saved on the desktop, you can use the following command:

cd ~/Desktop

Once you are in the correct directory, you need to make the script file executable. To do this, use the following command:

chmod +x file_operations.sh

This command sets the execute permission on the script file.

Finally, you can run the script using the following command:

./file_operations.sh

This will execute the script, and you will be prompted to enter the source file path, destination directory path, and the operation you want to perform (copy, move, or delete).

After you provide the required inputs, the selected operation will be performed on the file, and a success message will be displayed.
